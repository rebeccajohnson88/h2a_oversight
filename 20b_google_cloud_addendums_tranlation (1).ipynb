When it is the prevailing practice of non-H-2A agricultural employers in the occupation in the area to do so, or when the employer extends such benefits to similarly situated H-2A workers, the employer must advance the required transportation and subsistence costs (or otherwise provide them) to workers in corresponding employment who are traveling to the employer's work site. The amount of the transportation payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved.  he amount of the daily subsistence payment must be at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing the worker with three meals a day during employment (if applicable), but in no event less than the amount permitted under § 655.173(a) ”:  which is $12.46 per day published by the  Federal Register on Friday, March 22, 2019. 83 FR 10838.   The maximum amount is $ 55.00 per day(2) (with documentation of actual expenses)  The employer must also provide or pay the reasonable costs for lodging where lodging is necessary. If not provided by the employer, the amount an employer must pay for transportation and, where necessary, lodging must be no less than (and is not required to be more than) the most economical and reasonable costs.\\n\\n(2) Transportation from place of employment. If the worker completes the work contract period, or if the employee is terminated without cause, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H-2A employment, the employer must provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment, departed to work for the employer. If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has not agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's work site to such subsequent employer's work site, the employer must provide or pay for such expenses. If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer who has agreed in such work contract to provide or pay for the worker's transportation and daily subsistence expenses from the employer's work site to such subsequent employer's work site, the subsequent employer must provide or pay for such expenses. The employer is not relieved of its obligation to provide or pay for return transportation and subsistence if an H-2A worker is displaced as a result of the employer's compliance with the 50 percent rule as described in § 655.135(d) of this subpart with respect to the referrals made after the employer's date of need.The employer provides the worker with a cell phone - at no cost to the workers (except long distance charges). During times when the workers are located in an area where a cell signal is weak, the workers will be shown the area nearby where they can walk, drive or ride horse back to attain a cell signal. During times when the worker is located in an area where a cell signal is weak, the worker will be shown the area nearby where the worker can walk, drive or ride horse to attain a cell signal. Additionally, the employer will pre-schedule regular in-person visits to the camp to check on the worker and livestock. These visits occur every 3 days - at which time the employer brings potable water, fresh groceries, animal feed and other supplies – all at no cost to the worker.  \n",

El transporte provisto será de acuerdo con las leyes y regulaciones aplicables.\\nEmployer will provide cooking and kitchen facilities, housing, housing utilities, as well as transportation to assure workers access to stores where they can purchase groceries and other necessary items.  Housing will meet local, state, and federal housing standards.  \\nIf the employer has not previously advanced transportation and subsistence costs to the worker, then after the worker has completed 50% of the work contract period, the employer shall reimburse the worker for cost of transportation and daily subsistence from place of recruitment to place of work. Upon completion of the work contract employer will pay reasonable costs of return transportation and subsistence to the place of recruitment, except when the worker will not be returning to the place of recruitment, due to subsequent employment with another employer who agrees to pay such cost, in which case this employer only pays for the transportation to the next job. The amount of the transportation payment will be equal to the most economical and reasonable similar common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved except that any worker protected pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act will be paid in compliance with the FLSA beginning in the first work week . Daily subsistence payment will be at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing three meals a day during employment but in no less than the amount permitted under section 655.173(a), which is $12.46 (or most updated allowable meal charges and reimbursements for daily subsistence, whichever is greater); the maximum amount being $55.00 as the maximum amount for travel reimbursement for meals. If the employer has not prepaid transportation and meal expenses for the worker, then after the worker has served 50% of the duration of the employment contract, the employer shall reimburse the worker for transportation and meal expenses from the place of hiring to the workplace. Once the employment contract has ended, the employer will pay the reasonable expenses of return transportation and subsistence to the place of employment, except that the worker is not going to return to the place of employment, due to his subsequent employment with another employer who agrees to pay those costs, in which case this employer only pays for transportation to the next job. The transportation payment amount will be equal to the cheapest and most reasonable similar public transportation expense for the distances involved, except that any worker protected under the Fair Labor Standards Act will be paid in accordance with the FLSA principle on the first work week. The meal payment per day will be at least as much as the employer would charge the worker for providing three meals per day during the period of employment, but not less than the amount allowed by section 655.173(a), which is $12.46 (or most current allowable meal charges and reimbursements for daily subsistence, whichever is greater); the maximum amount is $55.00 as the maximum amount for travel reimbursement for meals.  \n",

and subsistence advanced/paid to a worker before 50% completion of the work contract may be deducted from the worker's pay in accordance with applicable state regulations, but will be reimbursed to the worker upon 50% completion of the work contract. When a longer-term contract is negotiated with a U.S. or H-2A worker, the employer is not relieved of the responsibility for reimbursement to the worker for travel and subsistence expenses incurred in getting to the job site which were advanced by the employer and subsequently withheld form the worker's pay until 50% of the original contract period elapsed. These payments will made to the U.S. and H-2A workers at the 50% completion point of the original period of employment. The employer is responsible for return transportation and subsistence expenses if the U.S. and H-2A worker successfully fulfills his/her obligations under the original terms of employment for less than 1 year.

The herder must have experience managing extreme winter conditions in a range to prevent death in sheep, goats, horses and dogs. Because animals exert more energy during the winter months, especially in extreme winter weather, the herder will need to monitor an animal&#39;s nutritional needs throughout the winter. Make sure animals have access to water that is not frozen and distribute emergency supplemental feed. Control snow levels to prevent sheep/goats from becoming paralyzed in deep snow or trapped against a fence. Herders must be experienced in identifying animals that are not receiving enough nutrition, maintaining a fresh supply of water in freezing temperatures, and how to keep animals in extreme weather conditions.

                   An employee may be terminated for just cause. Offenses considered just cause for termination of employment include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) Failure to report to work, excessive\\nabsences from work, or leaving the work site without approval; (b) Failure to follow employer?s directions. Some examples are: performing job duties in an unsafe manner or failure to accomplish\\ntasks according to designated timetables; (c) Gross negligence or deliberate actions which result in inferior work; waste, damage or injury to employer's property or livestock. Some examples are:\\nfailing to respond to livestock needs; abusing animals or equipment; refusing to carry out good faith, reasonable orders; being under the influence of alcohol or drugs; horseplay; (d) Deliberate\\ndamage or injury to another worker or his possessions; (e) Stealing company, ranch, employer or co-worker's property; (f) Possession of firearms or other weapons without employer authorization;\\nor (g) Changing application, or lying on employment application with regard to work experience.\\nThe employer will apply these standards uniformly and in a non-discriminatory manner, as required by law.\\nTermination may be carried out by the employer, but only after two written warnings (not necessarily for the same offense). The warnings will be written in a language understandable to the\\nemployee and the employee will be given an opportunity to sign the warning. Termination may be carried out without first having issued any warning, if the employee?s offense is of a severe or\\nemergency nature such as a threat to the life, safety and /or health of the worker, livestock or others; or, is the intentional destruction of property. If an employee is involuntarily terminated, the\\nworker will be provided a written statement explaining the cause/s for termination.\\nIf the employee voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the contract period, or is terminated for cause, and the employer will notify the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S.\\nDepartment of Labor notifies the CNPC, and DHS in the case of an H?2A worker, not later than 2 working days after such abandonment occurs., The employer will not be responsible for providing\\nor paying for the subsequent transportation and subsistence expenses of that employee under this section, and that employee is not entitled to the three-fourths guarantee. Abandonment will be\\ndeemed to begin after an employee fails to report for work at the regularly scheduled time for 5 consecutive working days without the consent of the employer.Workers are required to live on the ranch or on the range. An employer whose itinerary requires mobile housing may provide mobile housing. On ranches with more than one approved housing site, the workers will be required to live at any approved housing site, and to move from site to site as the work requires.All tools, supplies and equipment necessary to perform the duties assigned will be provided at no cost or deposit to the worker. Such items include equipment necessary for\\nhandling, treating, moving and protecting livestock, work clothing, footwear and safety gear appropriate for weather conditions and job duties, bedding gear and supplies\\nappropriate for maintaining clean and sanitary housing conditions.

and subsistence advanced/paid to a worker before 50% completion of the work contract may be deducted from the worker's pay in accordance with applicable state regulations, but will be reimbursed to the worker upon 50% completion of the work contract. When a longer-term contract is negotiated with a U.S. or H-2A worker, the employer is not relieved of the responsibility for reimbursement to the worker for travel and subsistence expenses incurred in getting to the job site which were advanced by the employer and subsequently withheld form the worker's pay until 50% of the original contract period elapsed. These payments will made to the U.S. and H-2A workers at the 50% completion point of the original period of employment. The employer is responsible for return transportation and subsistence expenses if the U.S. and H-2A worker successfully fulfills his/her obligations under the original terms of employment for less than 1 year. However, such payment does not actually have to be made to the U.S and H-2A worker until the worker and the employer sever their employer/employee relationship, which will occur at the point in time subsequent to the end of the original period of employment when a longer-term contract is negotiated. Successful completion of the original contract or job order entitles the worker to return transportation and subsistence regardless of performance under renewal or extended contract.ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION\\nCell phones, are provided without charge or deposit, to workers during the entire period of employment.

A referral is required. The employee must be able to identify approaching periods of storms and take precautions to prevent the herd from moving against a fence line where they huddle together and get swept away in the snow and freeze to death. The herder must have experience managing extreme winter conditions in a range to prevent death in sheep, goats, horses and dogs. Because animals exert more energy during the winter months, especially in extreme winter weather, the herder will need to monitor an animal&#39;s nutritional needs throughout the winter. Make sure animals have access to water that is not frozen and distribute emergency supplemental feed. Control snow levels to prevent sheep/goats from becoming paralyzed in deep snow or trapped against a fence. Herders must be experienced in identifying animals that are not receiving enough nutrition, maintaining a fresh supply of water in freezing temperatures, and how to keep animals in extreme weather conditions. Some work/tasks may occur outside the range, but more than 50% of the work will be done in the range. The Western Range Association and its member ranches facilitate good animal husbandry practices. Employees found to be abusing, neglecting, or abandoning livestock entrusted to their care may be terminated for cause. If an employee&#39;s negligent/abusive actions result in the loss/death of livestock/animals or cause harm to another person, the employee may be held liable for these actions. The worker will live in the housing provided by the employer. Such housing shall be clean and in good repair at the time it is provided to the employee. The employee is responsible for maintaining the housing unit at a reasonable level of cleanliness to prevent flies, mice, or other vermin. The employee is responsible for alerting the employer of damage to the dwelling unit within a reasonable period of time. The employee may be held liable for damage to the dwelling unit resulting from the employee&#39;s negligence (except normal wear and tear). **** Footnote on hours worked: up to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.****  \n",

                   An employee may be terminated for just cause. Offenses considered just cause for termination of employment include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) Failure to report to work, excessive\\nabsences from work, or leaving the work site without approval; (b) Failure to follow employer?s directions. Some examples are: performing job duties in an unsafe manner or failure to accomplish\\ntasks according to designated timetables; (c) Gross negligence or deliberate actions which result in inferior work; waste, damage or injury to employer's property or livestock. Some examples are:\\nfailing to respond to livestock needs; abusing animals or equipment; refusing to carry out good faith, reasonable orders; being under the influence of alcohol or drugs; horseplay; (d) Deliberate\\ndamage or injury to another worker or his possessions; (e) Stealing company, ranch, employer or co-worker's property; (f) Possession of firearms or other weapons without employer authorization;\\nor (g) Changing application, or lying on employment application with regard to work experience.\\nThe employer will apply these standards uniformly and in a non-discriminatory manner, as required by law.\\nTermination may be carried out by the employer, but only after two written warnings (not necessarily for the same offense). The warnings will be written in a language understandable to the\\nemployee and the employee will be given an opportunity to sign the warning. Termination may be carried out without first having issued any warning, if the employee?s offense is of a severe or\\nemergency nature such as a threat to the life, safety and /or health of the worker, livestock or others; or, is the intentional destruction of property. If an employee is involuntarily terminated, the\\nworker will be provided a written statement explaining the cause/s for termination.\\nIf the employee voluntarily abandons employment before the end of the contract period, or is terminated for cause, and the employer will notify the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S.\\nDepartment of Labor notifies the CNPC, and DHS in the case of an H?2A worker, not later than 2 working days after such abandonment occurs., The employer will not be responsible for providing\\nor paying for the subsequent transportation and subsistence expenses of that employee under this section, and that employee is not entitled to the three-fourths guarantee. Abandonment will be\\ndeemed to begin after an employee fails to report for work at the regularly scheduled time for 5 consecutive working days without the consent of the employer.Workers are required to live on the ranch or on the range. An employer whose itinerary requires mobile housing may provide mobile housing. On ranches with more than one approved housing site, the workers will be required to live at any approved housing site, and to move from site to site as the work requires.All tools, supplies and equipment necessary to perform the duties assigned will be provided at no cost or deposit to the worker. Such items include equipment necessary for\\nhandling, treating, moving and protecting livestock, work clothing, footwear and safety gear appropriate for weather conditions and job duties, bedding gear and supplies\\nappropriate for maintaining clean and sanitary housing conditions. Worker will be provided with effective electronic means of communication for work and emergencypurposes.\\nFor work and emergency purposes, this employer will provide Cellphones\\nIf worker is in an area where electronic communication will not work, the employer or person designated by employer will contact the worker in regular pre-scheduled visits at least every 7 days.Bonuses and/or wages that are higher than the guaranteed wage rate may be offered at the employer?s discretion. Any such added benefit(s), if elected by the employer, will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner to all employees under this job order who meet the employer's determined criteria, example: length of service with the employer.  \n",
